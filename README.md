# Weather-Map
## Description
In this homework we where tasked to make a weather page where people can look up cities and see what the weather will be like for today 
and the next 5 days. The city gives three weather descriptions for the day Temperature(Temp), Wind and Humidity and once a new city has 
been searched the location will be added to the side as a button for a quicker way to look up ther weather.

## User Story
